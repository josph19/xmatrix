          what you see here is the so-called hosen canri model sometimes also referred to as the X Matrix why X Matrix well not 100% sure but I think it has something to do with the big X here in the middle could be the reason anyway what we have here is we have a matrix and this Matrix is very very useful to translate strategic goals into annual goals into Improvement priorities and and measurements to keep track of those Improvement priorities and last but not least make sure that it's clear who is responsible for which part of all of our

          
          00:42
          Improvement priorities so what it actually does is it helps us to prevent a situation in which we do formulate strategic goals but we don't know what to do in the short term we don't know what buttons to turn and we don't know how to measure whether whether we are on the right track or not and we are not really assigning any responsibilities so here we cover all of these problems we start basically at the bottom where one or multiple strategic goals are formulated by an organization and a strategic goal has basically a long-term

          
          01:22
          perspective and so we talk about strategic goals uh when we have goals for the coming 3 to five years okay now suppose that for uh an organization a fictional organization their strategic goal was to increase employees in Department C by 50% in 5 years okay now what we do subsequently is we translate that into annual goals okay so what uh what should be happening in the coming five years is clear but what should happen in the coming year okay and we write the following down over here so for starters we want to increase

          
          01:58
          employees in departments see by 10% in the coming year okay 10% now you're free to choose here 10% or 20% or or 5% as long as all of these years combined eventually are going to add up to the 50% increase that you have as a goal and subsequently I also have another annual goal and that is reduce employee turnover to 5% okay now employee turnover is the people who leave now what I do subsequently is if you click over here you can basically uh select whether you want a little circle or a little cross and a circle means that

          
          02:40
          there's a primary relationship between the factors and a cross means there's a secondary relationship with a factor and obviously if there is nothing here that means no relationship or an extremely weak relationship now here I put um the the circle because obviously increasing employees by 10% is very strongly related to this strategic goal this one the next the one next to it so reducing employee turnover by 5% is a more indirect relationship with this one so I put there a secondary relationship there

          
          03:18
          now what are we going to do concretely to achieve this because these are nice goals to have for the coming year but what are you concretely going to do which buttons are are you going to uh basically play around with well in this particular case we came up with three uh things does it have to be three no you can also have four or five or six what is generally good is if you cover each one of these by at least two that's not always possible that's not always realistic but that is more or less the

          
          03:52
          goal which means that here we didn't cover all of them by two so this is not the the most optimal situation ation but be aware of what would be the optimal situation anyway what we're going to uh improve our Improvement priorities first of all we're going to introduce an employee satisfaction survey we're going to approach The Benchmark compensation package for our sector so we're going to look at what is let's say the standard in our sector and we're going to try to approach that so not be uh too different

          
          04:25
          from that in a negative way and we're going to do some business with a hat hunting agent genes so these are agencies that you pay and then they deliver you candidates they deliver you potential employees what we do here subsequently is the same as what we did before so with these little circles and these crosses uh or emptiness we indicate whether there's a a primary relationship a secondary relationship or no relationship uh at all if it's no relationship we just keep them blank uh but here for instance we put

          
          05:00
          um a little uh Circle which means there's a primary relationship or an important relationship between this Improvement effort so introducing the employee satisfaction survey and this goal namely reducing the employee turnover to 5% okay employee turnover is the amount of people who leave the organization okay so here we have basically our Improvement priorities now we need kpis or m key performance indicators or measures to keep track of how well our Improvement priorities are actually going because we do have to keep track

          
          05:38
          of that we cannot just you know after five years say hey you know what what we try to do failed you have to have these measurements throughout the process so you can see whether you're going in the right direction or not now for instance what we have one of the kpis is the employee satisfaction score and obviously that one has a a strong relationship or a primary relationship with this one namely introducing the employee satisfaction survey okay so this one has a a clear relationship with that however we don't have anything we

          
          06:13
          don't have a measurement for this one and we don't have a measurement for this one this is not uh the right way to go forward so at this point this uh Matrix basically warns you and say hey you have here two Improvement priorities that you don't have any kind of measurements for so you do need to come up with these measurements for instance just to give you an example here approaching the Benchmark compensation uh of the sector when it comes to compensation package well I might have here for instance as a

          
          06:47
          kpi the deviation between our package and the the the standard package in the uh in the sector so if if the standard package is that an employee earns I don't know 3 $1,000 and we right now uh give them $1,000 then the deviation is $2,000 okay now um the the the the depth or the uh um the size of that deviation that would be a decent kpi or a decent measurement to show whether we're on our way to achieve this particular um Improvement priority and obviously you also need to come up with an ice Ki for this one so this Matrix is

          
          07:32
          not just a nice list but it's also a warning um of of important factors missing what we do subsequently is per Improvement effort we're going to write down who is responsible for that so John Kim Akito we have these three employees and then we write down who is responsible for what for instance John is the primary responsible person for this one so uh but he is the secondary uh responsible person for uh this one okay because the primary responsible person for this one is actually Kim okay and uh This Is It
